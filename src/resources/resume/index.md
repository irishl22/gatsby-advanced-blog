## Summary
I am a former collegiate athlete and coach turned Web Developer that studied
Mathematics and Economics at the University of California, San Diego. After attending
the intensive 13-week coding bootcamp at DevMountain, I am seeking a full time
position as a Developer in the Greater Salt Lake City area. I believe with my newly
developed skills in React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node, etc. and my past experience in
operations, digital production and mathematics I am a strong candidate for a position in
the software engineering industry.
