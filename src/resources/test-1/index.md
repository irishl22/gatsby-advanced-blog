# A Little About Me

## CALIFORNIA BORN AND RAISED
- I was born in Berkeley, California and grew up in the Bay Area. Living in a small surf town called Half Moon Bay, I spent most
of my days outdoors with friends and family either at the beach or exploring Montara Mountain and the coastal trail. Fast forwarding to 
the end of High School, I was recruited to run Track & Field at UC San Diego and would go on to graduate with a degree in Math and Economics.
Being a student athlete was certainly challenging but also one of the greatest experiences of my life. So much so that I decided to stay with the 
program after being offered a position of Director of Operations once I graduated. I stayed three additional years with the team and found coaching and management to be extremely rewarding and exciting. However, I had a thirst for web development and left my position to attend DevMountain. 
And there my love for coding became undeniable....

## Fun Facts and Hobbies
- In February 2019 I was inducted into the Half Moon Bay High School Hall of Fame as a Track & Field athlete.
- I continue to compete in races like Spartan, Epic Series OCR and Tough Mudders. I'm always up for a new fitness challenge!
- I love going to the beach, spending time with my family (especially my newphew), and will always jump on the opportuniity to bike, backpack or
go camping!
- I love math so much I got a tattoo of the Fibonacci spiral on my side.
